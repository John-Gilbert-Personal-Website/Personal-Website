        <div class="contentMatter"><p>I am a former investment banker who left the financial industry after becoming a whistleblower in a 
        small regulatory inquiry, a life-changing step that grew into serving a material role as a witness in a 
        multi-million dollar federal fraud investigation. The stress associated with this led me to leave the 
        professional world several years ago, and since 2019 I have been a top performer at several different 
        Amazon facilities in multiple states. </p>
        

        <p>I completed my bachelor's in Math Theory at the University of Kansas before earning a pair of master's
         and a juris doctor, and I am Life & Health insurance license in 29 states, and have worked Medicare 
         open enrollment each year since 2020. In 2016 I joined Field Gulls, the SBNation fan site of the 
         Seattle Seahawks, in 2016, and took on the role of Deputy Editor in early 2020 where I specialize in 
         the salary cap, the collective bargaining agreement and statistical analysis, with an occasional 
         film breakdown sprinkled in.</p>
